# Spot Your System's Tipping Point

## Is Software Too Hard?

Brain has lots of bottlenecks and biases
- imperfect memory
- restricted attention span
- limited multitasking abilities

This should make coding hard, but we're great at workarounds:
- abstraction
- cohesion
- good naming
- also on a system level
    - group functions in modules
    - aggregate modules into subsystems
    - subsystems compose a system

A system under development is a moving target

As a project grows beyond 12 or 15 developers, coordination, motivation, and communication issues tend to cause a significant cost overhead

### Societies Within a Software System

Ex. Linux repo has 16,241 contributors

### Raise The Abstraction Level

Social analyses on a subsystem level benefit a larger organization better
