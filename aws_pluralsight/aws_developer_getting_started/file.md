Think of your application as just the core logic that connects to other AWS services

AWS is a "web" of services

EC2 - service that provides servers for your app
  - forms the basis for other apps like RDB service and Elastic Beanstalk

  AWS Tooling
  - web console
  - CLI 
  - AWS SDKs
    - .NET, Ruby, iOS, JS, Java, etc. 
  
AWS access key gives access for SDK and CLI
