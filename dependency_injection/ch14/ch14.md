# Chapter 14 - The Simple Injector DI Container

- Simple Injector is a modern DI Container that offers a fairly comprehensive feature set, but its API is quite different from most DI Containers. The following are a few of its characteristic attributes:
- Scopes are ambient.
- Sequences are registered using Collection.Register instead of appending new registrations of the same Abstraction.
- Sequences behave as streams.
- The container can be diagnosed to find common configuration pitfalls.
- An important overall theme for Simple Injector is one of strictness. It doesn’t attempt to guess what you mean and tries to prevent and detect configuration errors through its API and diagnostic facility.
- Simple Injector enforces a strict separation of registration and resolution. Although you use the same Container instance for both register and resolve, the Container is locked after first use.
- Because of Simple Injector’s ambient scopes, resolving from the root container directly is good practice and encouraged: it doesn’t lead to memory leaks or concurrency bugs.
- Simple Injector supports the standard Lifestyles: Transient, Singleton, and Scoped.
- Simple Injector has excellent support for registration of sequences, Decorators, Composites, and generics.
