# Chapter 15 - The Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection DI Container

- The Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (MS.DI) DI Container has a limited set of features. A comprehensive API that addresses Auto-Registration, Decorators, and Composites is missing. This makes it less suited for development of applications that are designed around the principles and patterns presented in this book.
- MS.DI enforces a strict separation of concerns between configuring and consuming a container. You configure components using a ServiceCollection instance, but a ServiceCollection can’t resolve components. When you’re done configuring a ServiceCollection, you use it to build a ServiceProvider that you can use to resolve components.
- With MS.DI, resolving from the root container directly is a bad practice. This will easily lead to memory leaks or concurrency bugs. Instead, you should always resolve from an IServiceScope.
- MS.DI supports the three standard Lifestyles: Transient, Singleton, and Scoped.
