# Chapter 7 - Managing Managers

## Skip Level Meetings

- Meeting with people who report to the people who report to you
- One form is 1-1 meetings held quarterly with each person
    - Helps humanize folks; less likely to be seen as "resources"
- Suggest prompts for discussion. Examples:
    - What has your team been doing well lately?
    - Do you have any feedback about your manager?
    - Are there any areas of business strategy you don't understand?
- Another form is group meetings because 1-1 meetings don't scale well
    - Questions
        - Is this team working poorly with any other teams, from your perspective?
        - Are there any questions about the larger organization that I can answer?

## Manager Accountability

Universal goal of managers under you: *they should be making your life easier*

Accountability is complex

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The People Pleaser

People pleasers
- Has an aversion to making people unhappy
- Seems to never get anything done
- Overpromises and underdelivers
- Never pushes back on work

Different flavors
- Team people pleaser
- External people pleaser

What can you do?
- Help the person feel safer saying "no" and externalizing decisions so they don't take failure personally
- Create better processes for getting work scheduled that don't rely solely on a manager's discretion

## Managing New Managers

Common signs of struggling first-time managers
    - Overwork
    - Feeling the need to be in control of everything and make all decisions

Let people who want to become managers start with baby steps like mentoring team members

## Managing Experienced Managers

Make sure manager fits culture of your team

Managers create subcultures

You're responsible for creating the culture of your organization

## Hiring New Managers

Two part process
1) Make sure they have the skills you need
2) Make sure they're a culture match for your organization

A manager must be able to debug teams

Ask them about their management philosophy. If they don't have one, that might be a red flag. A new manager might not have one, but an experienced one should

You want to get a measure of their technical skills to see if they'll be credible to the team they're managing

Do reference checks. Ask what the managers do well and what drives their references crazy

## Debugging Dysfunctional Organizations

Great managers are often great debuggers because they want to find out "why"

## Setting Expectations and Delivering on Schedule

You'll have to do some degree of estimation, even if you don't like it

Learn from the past

## Challenging Situations: Roadmap Uncertainty

### Strategies for handling roadmap uncertainty
- Be realistic about the likelihood of changing plans given the size and stage of the company you work for
- Think about how to break down big projects into a series of smaller deliverables so that you can achieve some of the results, even if you don’t necessarily complete the grand vision
- Don’t overpromise a future of technical projects
- Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to "sustaining engineering"
- Understand how important various engineering projects really are

## Staying Technically Relevant

- Oversee technical investment
- Ask informed questions
- Analyze and explain engineering and business tradeoffs
- Make specific requests
- Use your experience as a gut check

## Assessing Your Own Experience

How often do you talk to your skip-level reports? Do you meet with them one on one, or as groups? How do you proactively reach out to your teams? How much time do you spend seeking out information, instead of passively handling the information that comes to you? When was the last time you sat in on a team meeting?

Without looking at your existing documentation, write down your view of the job description for the engineering managers who report to you.

    What are they responsible for?

    How do you evaluate them?

    What areas are most important for success, in your opinion?

Now, look at the job description your company uses. Are there differences in what you wrote compared to that description, or do they match well? Given that description, what things are you potentially overlooking in evaluating them?

Finally, do a quick mental review of their current performance. What areas need coaching and development? Make time to cover this in your next 1-1.

If you manage an area that is outside of your technical comfort zone, how often do you check in on that area to make sure things are going well? Have you taken some time to learn from the manager of that area a little bit about what it takes to succeed in that role? What new things have you learned in the past three months that help you understand that team better?

If you have one team that is clearly operating more smoothly than others, what are the differences you notice in their processes? Their interactions? Is their manager doing things differently than other managers? How does the team interact with that manager, and how does that manager interact with you?

What is your interview process for managers? Do you spend time talking about their personal values and their management philosophy? Do you have the team interview their potential manager, or do you keep them out of the process? Do you spend time getting references for candidates?

What are your organization’s goals this quarter? This year? How are you merging product goals (if any) with the technical goals? Does your organization have a mandate that is well understood by the teams?
