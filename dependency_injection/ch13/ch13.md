# Chapter 13 - The Autofac DI Container

- The Autofac DI Container offers a fairly comprehensive API and addresses many of the trickier situations you typically encounter when you use DI Containers.
- An important overall theme for Autofac seems to be one of explicitness. It doesn’t attempt to guess what you mean, but rather offers an easy-to-use API that provides you with options to explicitly enable features.
- Autofac enforces stricter separation of concerns between configuring and consuming a container. You configure components using a ContainerBuilder instance, but a ContainerBuilder can’t resolve components. When you’re done configuring a ContainerBuilder, you use it to build an IContainer that you can use to resolve components.
- With Autofac, resolving from the root container directly is a bad practice. This can easily lead to memory leaks or concurrency bugs. Instead, you should always resolve from a lifetime scope.
- Autofac supports the standard Lifestyles: Transient, Singleton, and Scoped.
- Autofac allows working with ambiguous constructors and types by providing an API that allows supplying code blocks. This allows any code that creates a service to be executed.
