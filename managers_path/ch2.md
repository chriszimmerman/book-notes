# Mentoring

## The Importance of Mentoring to Junior Team Members

A mentor gets the change to see what it's like to have responsibility for another person

## Being a Mentor

An opportunity to learn in a farily safe way about the job of management

### Mentoring an Intern

Giving a good impression on an intern can have the positive benefit of the intern spreading good words about your company to others

Find a good project for them to work on

Sit with them as much as possible the first few days. Make sure they're not lost or overwhelmed

Once you have a project, start applying your project management knowledge
- Is the project broken down into milestones?
- Does it make sense to the intern?

#### Listen Carefully

Listening - most basic skill of managing people
- Pay attention to what your mentee is saying
- Pay attention to body language
- Spend the time to make sure you feel understood, and that you understand your mentee
  
#### Clearly Communicate

- Set expectations around when to ask for help, how long to try to figure out a problem before asking for help, etc.

#### Calibrate Your Response

- Early on, you leran how often you have to check in with an intern

### Mentoring A Summer Intern

- Prepare for his arrival
  - e.g. Physical envrionment, hardware, software
- Have a project for him to work on
  - Clear project
  - Specific, not urgent
  - Something relevant, but could be completed by an entry-level team member in half the time the intern will be there
- Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program
  - Gives expectation that you want them to finish a project

### Mentoring A New Hire

Your job as a new hire mentor
- Onboarding
- Helping this person adjust to life in the company effectively
- Building your and her network of contacts in the company

Keep unspoken rules in mind
- e.g. You don't take vacation the week after Thanksgiving if you work in ecommerce because that's a very important week for business

Have new hire go through onboarding documents and help modify those documents for any surprises encountered when onboarding

Introduce the new person around so that they can build their network

### Technical or Career Mentoring

#### When You Are A Mentor

Tell the mentee what you expect of them

It's also OK to say no to mentoring
- You can feel obligated to say yes to every person who asks you for help, but your time is valuable
- Don't say yes and then fail to actually do the mentoring work

#### When You Are A Mentee

- Think about what you want to get out of this relationship, and come prepared to your sessions
- You don't have to have a mentor

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek

In some offices, you'll encounter an "alpha geek"
- Driven to be 
  - the best engineer on the team
  - to always have the right answer
  - to be the person who solves all the hard problems
- Values intelligence above all traits
- Usually can't deal with dissent
- Easily threatened by those they perceive as trying to steal their spotlight or upstage them
- Believes themselves to be the best, and responds only to messages that support that view
- Tries to create a culture of *excellence*, but ends up creating a culture of **fear**
- Usually an excellent engineer who goes into management because
  - they were pushed into it, or
  - they believe the smartest person on the team should be the manager
- May take credit for all the work a team does rather than acnkowledge the strength of team members
- At their best, they can be very knowledgeable (and remind you of how knowledgeable they are)
- At their worst, they can't let anyone else get glory without claiming some of it for themselves
  - Can be threatened by criticisms of their designs or technical decisions


The alpha geek habit often starts to show up when engineers first become mentors

If people don't come to you for help despite your strong technical skills, ask yourself: are you showing signs of being an alpha geek?

Mentoring can be a great opportunity to break out of the alpha geek habit
    - Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach
    - Can learn how to communicate in a way that will be well-received by others

## Tips for the Manager of a Mentor

What you measure, you improve
    - Create clear, focused, measurable goals
    - Figure out what you want to get out of a mentor/mentee relationship for your new hire/intern

Make sure that there is some guidance and structure to a mentoring program before you push people on it

Recognize that this is an additional responsibility for a mentor

A common mentoring pitfall is viewing it as a low-status "emotional labor" position
- Recognize mentoring for the work that it is and treat it as a first-class citizen with respect to other responsibilities someone might have

Do not assume that like must mentor like
- e.g. Do not expect women to only mentor women, people of color to only mentor people of color, etc.

Use this opportunity to reward and train future leaders on your team

### Hiring Interns

Don't hire interns who are not going to graduate in the year after their internship
- Your internship program is not a way for you to get extra work done; it is to identify and attract talent
- People more than two years away from graduation are more likely to look for more opportunities to explore

Hiring interns is relatively easy compared to hiring full-time graduates
- There's less demand for interns, so you should have a lot of options
- Try to push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups
  - Diversity in your internship program leads to diversity in your grad hiring, and your organization

## Key Takeaways for the Mentor

Be curious and open minded
- When we close our minds, we stop learning
- Technology is always changing around us, so we must continually learn and grow
- Mentoring helps see the world through fresh eyes
  - Assumptions you've made will be questioned
  - Working with new people can shed light on patterns previously hidden to you

Listen and Speak Their Language
- Mentoring, done well, starts to shape the skills every future leader needs
- Requires you to practice listening
- Software development is a team sport; communication is key

Make Connections
- Mentoring is a great way to build your network
- A mentee can introduce you to your next job in the future, or could work for you in the future


## Assessing Your Own Experience

Does your company have an internship program? If so, can you volunteer to mentor an intern?

How does your company think about onboarding? Do you assign mentors to new hires? If not, can you propose to your manager that you try doing this, and volunteer to mentor someone?

Have you ever had a great mentor? What did that person do that made you think he or she was great? How did the mentor help you learn—what did he or she teach you?

Have you ever had a mentoring relationship that didn’t work out? Why didn’t it work out? What lessons about that experience can you apply to avoid similar failures going forward?
