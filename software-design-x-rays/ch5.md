# The Principles of Code Age

## Stabilize Code by Age

Desigining code by age

1) organize code by age
2) turn stable packages into libraries; and
3) move and refactor code we fail to stabilize

Advantages to this:
- Promotes long-term memory models of code - stable packages
- Lessens cognitive load since there's less active code
- Prioritizes test suites to shorten lead times
