# Management 101

## What to expect from a manager

"Benign negelect" isn't so bad, considering the alternatives

But there are other options. Managers who:
- Care about you as a person
- Actively help you grow in your career
- Teach you important skills & give valuable feedback
- Help you navigate difficult situations & figure out what to learn
- Want you to take their job someday
- Help you understand what's important to focus on, and enable that focus

### One-on-One Meetings

Two purposes:

1) Create a human connection between you and your manager
2) A regular opportunity to speak privately with your manager about what needs discussing

Shouldn't just be a status meeting

### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

Quick feedback is best, whether positive or negative

### Training and Career Growth

Expect that you are responsible, for the most part, for figuring out what types of training you want

## How to Be Managed

### Spend Time Thinking About What You Want

It's okay to go through periods of uncertainty in your career

Ultimately, you pull yourself through the uncertainty. Use your manager to discover what's possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next

### You Are Responsible for Yourself

Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want.

Bring agendas to your 1-1s when you have things to talk about
- Seeking feedback
- When you're persistently unhappy
- When you are stuck
- When you want a raise

### Give Your Manager A Break

Your relationship with your manager is like any other close interpersonal relationship

### Choose Your Managers Wisely

Your manager can make a huge difference in your career
    - evaulate your manager when evaluating job opportunities

## Assessing Your Own Experience

- Have you had a manager you considered good? What did this manager do that you found valuable?
- How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager? Do you come to 1-1s with your manager bringing topics to discuss? If your 1-1 is a status meeting, can you use some other means to convey that status?
- Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major life event? Do you feel that your manager knows something about you personally?
- Has your manager delivered good feedback to you? Bad feedback? Any feedback at all?
- Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?
