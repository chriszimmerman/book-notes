## Power Editing

Achieve editor fluency

What counts as being "fluent"?
- When editing text, move and make selections by character, word, line, and paragraph
- When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules...)
- Reindent code following changes
- Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command
- Undo and redo changes
- Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them
- Navigate to a particular line number
- Sort selected lines
- Search for both strings and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches
- Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel
- Display compilation errors in the current project
- Run the current project's tests

Can you do all this without using a mouse or trackpad?

How to do this
- First, look at yourself while editing. Each time you find yourself doing something repetitive, say to your self, "There must be a better way" then find it
- Once you find a new useful feature, you need to get it installed in your muscle memory, so you can use it without thinking. The only way to do this is through repetition.
