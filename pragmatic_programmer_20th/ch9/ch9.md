## Coconuts Don't Cut It

Do what works; not what's fashionable

Don't cargo cult

Deliver when users need it

## Pragmatic Starter Kit

Use version control to drive builds, tests, & releases

Use saboteurs to test your testing

Test state coverage, not code coverage

Find bugs once

Don't use manual procedures
