# Bootstrapping Culture

Part of your job at an executive level is to set the culture of your function

Learning instead of structure; Transparency instead of process

There are only a few situations in which an unstructured group can work

1) Task oriented. The task basically structures the group
2) Small and homogenous
3) High degree of communication
4) The is a low degree of skill specialization

## Assessing Your Role

Regcognize the size of the vessel you're steering. This is determined by a number of factors:
- People
- Age
- Size of existing infrastructure
- Risk tolerance

## Creating Your Culture

*Culture is how things get done, without people having to think about it.*

## Applying Core Values

Define your culture
- If you have a set of values, map those onto your team

Reinforace your culture by rewarding those who exhibit its values in positive ways

Learn to spot those who have friction with your culture

## Creating Cultural Policy

Don't copy-paste; what may work for another company may not work for yours

## Writing a Career Ladder

Look for examples
Be detailed
Use both long-form descriptions and summaries
Consider how the ladder relates to salary

Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages
Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels
Consider your breakpoint levels

Split management and technical tracks
Consider making people management skills a mid-career requirement
Years of experience
Donâ€™t be afraid to evolve over time
