# Chapter 4 - Managing People

Main tasks required to manage people:

- Taking on a new report
- Holding regular 1-1s
- Giving feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted
- Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring

## Starting a New Reporting Relationship Off Right

### Build Trust and Rapport

Get to know the person with a series of questions so you can manage them well

Examples:
- How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
- What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?
- Why did you decided to work here? What are you excited about?
- How do I know when you're in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?
- Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
- Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?
- Any surprises since you've joined, good or bad, that I should know about?

### Create a 30/60/90-Day Plan

Helps prioritize what things to get up to speed on

This helps catch mishires quickly

Create a set of realistic milestones based on prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in

### Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation

Make edits to reflect changes since last hires, or points that are found confusing

### Communicate Your Style and Expectations

Set expectations on things like: how often to meet, how info will be shared, how often a manager will review their work

### Get Feedback from Your New Hire

Get as much feedback as possible in the 1st 90 days

People just coming in have a fresh perspective and see things that are hard for established team members to see

## Communicating with Your Team

### Have Regular 1-1s

Start with assuming you need regular 1-1s then go from there

### Scheduling 1-1s

Start weekly

Adjust the frequency if you both agree this is what you need

Schedule when you'll both be in the office. Mornings before things get busy work

### Adjusting 1-1s

Take different factors when considering 1-1s:
- How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
- How much coaching does this person need?
- How much does this person push information up to you?
- How good is your relationship with this person?
- How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company?

## Different 1-1 Styles

### The To-Do List Meeting

- One or both parties come up with list of objectives to cover
- Follows "don't waste time with pointless meetings" mandate
- The list can feel artificial and made of things that could be handled via email
- Make sure there are verbal nuances that deserve verbal communication
- Can feel cold

### The Catch-up

- More fluid
- Don't let it turn into a complaining session or therapy

### The Feedback Meeting

-Devoted to feedback and coaching
- Don't wait for 1-1s to provide corrective feedback

### The Progress Report

- When you're managing managers
- For 1-1s, only use them for progress reporting when the individual is on a side project you're not personally overseeing

### Getting to Know You

- Leave room to get to know the person as a human being
- Care about them as individuals
- Ask them about long-term career goals

### Mix It Up

- Can do 1-1s as walking meetings, over coffee, or outside of the office
- Don't rely on those for critical conversations
- Try to keep notes in a shared document, with you the manager playing note taker

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator

Autonomy goes away when teams are micromanaged

Some junior folks thrive on micromanagement because they need direction

Delegation is not the same thing as just abandoning someone - there is still involvement to make sure projects succeed

## Practical Advice for Delegating Effectively

### Use the Team's Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into

When you feel like you want to micromanage, ask the team how they're measuring success and ask them to make that visible to you on an ongoing basis

Sharing nothing may be a sign of needing course correction, which means digging into more details

What are you holding them accountable for this month, this quarter, or this year?

### Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People

It's easy for engineers to push up information without management doing much work to ask for it:
- Version control system
- Ticketing system
- Alerts, metrics, what happened on-call

Get information from these systems before going to the people

### Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects

System design and project goals are more important at beginning of a project

Progress details become more important toward the end of a project

During normal workflow, knowing what's moving forward and what's taking longer than normal should be enough

### Establish Standards for Code and Systems

Code/testing/review standards

Helps depersonalize the process of providing technical feedback

### Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive Way

**Hiding information intentionally is a failure. Getting stuck on a problem or making a mistake is often just an opportunity for learning.**

If you don't learn how to let go of details, delegate, and trust your team, you're likely to suffer personally.

## Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback

Performance reviews are huge feedback loops. Start with continuous feedback

Raise issues as they happen

Steps to give continuous feedback:

- Know your people
  - What are their strengths and weaknesses?
  - What are their goals?
  - What level are they operating at?
  - What do they need to do to get to the next level?
- Observe your people
  - Recognize talents and achievements on your team
- Provide lightweight, regular feedback
  - Start with positive feedback
  - Talk regularly
- Provide coaching
  - Form a partnership with your direct report where the two of you are working together to help her grow

## Performance Reviews

360 model
- manager receives feedback as well

### Writing and Delivering a Performance REview

#### Give Yourself Enough Time, and Start Early

Plan to spend solid, uninterrupted time working on reviews

#### Try to Account for the Whole Year, Not Just The Past Couple of Months

Keep notes throughout the whole year

You want to track growth and change you've seen over the past year

#### Use Concrete Examples, and Exceprts from Peer Reviews

If you can't use a concrete example to support a point, ask yourself if you need to communicate that point

#### Spend Plenty of Time on Accomplishments and Strengths

Celebrate Achievements

Don't skimp on positive feedback

#### When It Comes to Areas for Improvement, Keep It Focused

Very little improvement feedback means that the person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work

#### Avoid Big Surprises

If someone is underperforming, the review should not be the first time they hear about it

#### Schedule Enough Time to Discuss the Review

Give people a printed copy

## Cultivating Careers

You will play a key role in getting people on your team promoted

Figure out how the promotion game works at your company

## Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers

HR dictates a lot of the firing process these days

PIP - Personal Improvement Plan

Don't give surprises. Make expectations clear.

You'll always need to have a record of negative feedback to fire someone in any environment where HR is active and a standard performance improvement plan is required

Give feedback in writing so that you have a paper trail

Don't put anyone on a plan whom you wouldn't be happy to lose

## Assessing Your Own Experience

Have you set up regular 1-1s with your direct reports?

When was the last time you talked to your reports about their career development? If it was more than three months ago, can you make sure to put this in your next 1-1s?

Have you given feedback to your reports in the last week? When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team?

When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public?

Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable?

What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you?

Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?
