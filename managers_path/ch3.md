# Chapter 3 - Tech Lead

What *is* a tech lead?
- A set of responsibilities, not a point on the ladder
- Doesn't have to be the most experienced person on the team
- Helps develop project management skills
- Is an exercise in influencing without authority
- Helps change focus from on yourself to your team

## All Great Tech Leads Know This One Weird Trick

Learning the art of **balance**
- Balancing your technical commitments with the work the whole team needs
- You'll have to learn new skills, and not just rely on the ones you already know

## Being a Tech Lead 101

### The Main Roles of a Tech Lead

You have to take a wide view of the work so that you can keep the project moving

#### Systems Architect and Business Analyst

- Identify critical systems that need to change and the critical features that need to be built in order to deliver upcoming projects
- There's a lot of value in spending time thinking through the externalities and issues related to  a project
- You need to have a good sense of the overall architecture of your systems and a solid understanding of how to design complex software
- Also need to understand business requirements and translate them into software

#### Project Planner

- Break work down into rough deliverables
- Challenge - trying to get as much productive work done in parallel as possible
- Find places to apply agreed-upon abstractions
  - e.g. Agreeing on the interface for a JSON API and have the API return dummy data so that the front-end team can get started quickly
- Gathering input from experts on the team
- Start identifying priorities

#### Software Developer and Team Leader

- Write code, communicate challenges, and delegate
- Tech leads should continue writing code, but not too much
- Voice challenges to the right people as early as possible
  - In a healthy org, there is no shame or harm in raising issues early
- Look for opportunities to delegate work

Being promoted to tech lead is like being given the "Stone of Triumph" (Simpsons joke)

## Managing Projects

- Project management is tedious, and sometimes scary, but still necessary to do
- Project managers can be a crutch for engineers to use instead of learning to think through their future work
- Planning makes you think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens

Take the time to explain technical concepts to nontechnical people in a nonthreatening, noncondescending way

## Managing a Project

1) Break down the work
   1) Break down the deliverable into tasks
   2) Start with biggest pieces, break those into small pieces, and those pieces into smaller pieces
2) Push through the details and the unknowns
   1) Push past moments of irritation, boredom, and pain in project management
   2) Work through the unknowns until you really feel that there is no more value to be gained in spending time on them
3) Run the project and adjust the plan as you go
   1) When things slip, keep everyone apprised of the status
   2) Having a plan means having milestones to point to so that you know how much work remains
4) Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes
   1) Take insights from breaking down project and apply them if requirements change mid-flight
   2) If the changes add significant risk to the project, necessitate new planning/rework, and be clear about the cost of those changes
   3) Know what features you can prioritize or cut if you need to do so because of a hard deadline
5) Revisit the details as you get close to completion
   1) Run a *premortem* - a list of things that could fail on the launch of the big project
   2) Decide where "good enough" is and commit to it
   3) Cut work that falls below the "good enough" line
   4) Make a launch plan and a rollback plan
   5) Don't forget to celebrate at the end

Don't push people into management roles

## Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager

### Imagined Life of a Senior Individual Contributor

Perfect blanace of engaging work, fame, and accumulated expertise

### Real Life of a Senior Individual Contributor

It's up to you to find the large initiatives in the org

Mix of wanting too much of your time or being scared of you from new developers

Life isn't so bad

### Imagined Life of a Manager

You get to make decisions, create the culture, and your effectiveness is evident to all around you

### Real Life of a Manager

You have mostly meetings all day, you have some control

It's hard to get things out of some of your developers; some don't even tell you what's wrong until they announce that they're leaving

Other managers are not interested in your feedback and your own manager has coaching skills that leave a lot to be desired

- Each track has its benefits and drawbacks

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar

- The Process Czar believes one true process will solve all problems if correctly and exactly followed
- Can be valuable because they make sure no task is forgotten or that all things that should be are wrapped up
- Fail to realize that others are not as good at following processes as they are
  - Blame problems on failure to follow process instead of acknowledging the need for flexibility and unexpected changes

Ironically, "agile" is often implemented in a rigid way

As a new tech lead
- be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team
  - Look for self-regulating, automated processes so you don't have to be a rules cop

As the manager of a process czar
- Help them get comfortable with ambiguity
  - Make it clear that's it's safe to fail and be imperfect

## How to Be a Great Tech Lead

### Understand the Architecture

Take time to understand it

### Be a Team Player

Working with the less exciting parts of the codebase can teach you a lot about where the process is broken

Don't always self-sacrifice in what you want to work on

### Lead Technical Decisions

Determine which decisions must be made by you, which should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which require the whole team to solve

### Communicate

Communication skills are invaluable

Practice your writing and speaking skills

Write blog posts, speak at meetups

## Assessing Your Own Experience

Does your organization have tech leads? Is there is a written job description for this role? If so, what does it say? If not, how would you define the role in your organization? How would a tech lead define the role?

If you are considering becoming a tech lead, are you ready to push yourself? Are you comfortable spending some of your time outside of the code? Do you feel like enough of an expert in your code base to successfully lead others as they work in it?

Have you asked your manager what he or she expects from the tech lead?

Who is the best tech lead you ever worked with? What are some things that person did that made him or her great?

Have you worked with a frustrating tech lead? What did he or she do that frustrated you?
