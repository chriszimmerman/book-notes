# Chapter 8 - Before the Project

## The Requirements Pit

No one knows exactly what they want

Our job is to help people understand what they want

Requirements are learned in a feedback loop

Work with a user to think like a user

The best requirements documentation, perhaps the only requirements documentation, is working code

Maintain a glossary - one place that defines all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project

## Working Together

Work closely with users

### Pair Programming

One dev operates the keyboard; the other does not

Both work on the problem together and switch duties as needed

Typist focuses on low-level details of syntax & coding style; other dev is free to consider higher-level issues & scope

Pepper-pressure of a seocnd person helps against moments of weakness & bad habies of naming variables *foo* and such

### Mob Programming

Have a dozen or so diverse people tackling a problem

Don't go into the code alone

## The Essense of Agility

Agile is not a noun; agile is how you do things

Agile is not a box you check

Agile manifesto

- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
