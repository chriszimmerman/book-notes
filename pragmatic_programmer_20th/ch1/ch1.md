Your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you - and you need to be comfortable relying on them as well

Take responsibility
- When you make a mistake or an error in judgement, admit it honestly and try to offer options
- Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse
- **Provide options, don't make lame excuses**
