# Chapter 6 - Managing Multiple Teams

Managing multiple teams means you've probably moved away from "maker" into "manager"

You can still stay hands on by
- Being a secondary code reviewer
- Staying engaged with systems you created (since you have knowledge of those systems)

Gain a mastery of programming before moving into management
- Fluency in working in a language is something that sticks with you for a long time

Keep at least a solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings or other obligations
- Spend at least some time on a creative pursuit
  - Engineering blog posts, prepare conference talks, participate in open source

## Managing Your Time: What's Important, Anyway?

Understand the difference between *importnace* and *urgency*

## Decisions and Delegation

- Delegate simple and frequent tasks
- Handle simple and infrequent tasks yourself
- Use complex and infrequent tasks as training opportunities for rising leaders
- Delegate complex and frequent tasks to develop your team

## Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No

- "Yes, and"
  - Respond positively while articulating the boundaries of reality
- Create Policies
  - Repeatedly saying no over and over again giving the same reasons is a basis for a policy
- "Help Me Say Yes"
  - Helps dig in on the elements that seem questionable
- Appeal to Budget
- Work as a Team
- Don't Prevaricate
  - Don't agonize over the process of saying "no"

## Technical Elements Beyond Code

Need to develop an eye for the technical health signals for the overall team

- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
- Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?

## Measuring the Health of Your Development Team

### Frequency of Releases

### Frequency of Code Check-ins

Team needs to be able to break work into small chunks

### Frequency of Incidents

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Us Verses Them, Team Player

Shallow binding e.g. new CTO hires people she knows from old company
- Fragile to the loss of the leader
- Resistant to outside ideas
- Empire building
- Inflexibility

Purpose-based binding
- Resilient to loss of individuals
- Driven to find better ways to achieve their purpose
- First-team focused
- Open to changes that serve their purpose

## The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience

Teach the team how to focus
- Figure out what's important
- Go home

Burnout is real

## Assessing Your Own Experience

When was the last time you reviewed your schedule for things that you’re doing but that aren’t providing a lot of value for you or your team? Look back on the past couple of weeks. Look forward to the next couple of weeks. What did you accomplish, and what do you hope to accomplish?

If you are still writing code, how does this fit in with the rest of your schedule? Are you doing it after hours? What’s driving you to continue to spend this time?

What was the last task you delegated to a member of one of your teams? Was it simple or complex? How is the person you delegated to handling the new task?

Who are the rising leaders of your teams? What is your plan for coaching them to take on bigger leadership roles? What tasks are you giving them to prepare them for more responsibility?

Does the process of writing, releasing, and supporting code seem to function smoothly on your teams? When was the last time there was a noticeable incident with part of this process? What happened, and how did the team respond to it? How often does the process encounter these exceptional conditions?

When was the last time you pushed your team to cut the scope of a project? When you cut scope do you cut features, technical quality, or both? How do you decide?

When was the last time you sent email after 8 pm or on the weekend? Did the person you sent that email to respond? Did you need him or her to respond?
