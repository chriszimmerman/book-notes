# Chapter 5 - Managing A Team

## Staying Technical

Being an engineering manager
- You may stop writing code, but you will guide decision making

Being technically credible helps you be successful

Still coding helps you see the technical issues & bottlenecks in the code

## Debugging Dysfunctional Teams: The Basics

### Not Shipping

Help identify the cause e.g. not shipping

### People Drama

Get rid of "brilliant assholes"

### Unhappiness Due to Overwork

Dedicate 20% of your time to sustainability work

Learn as much as you can about a crunch period to avoid it next time

### Collaboration Problems

Be willing to improve collaboration with other teams

## The Shield

Focus on things they can impact and change; Ignore the things they can't 

It's unrealistic to think you can shield your team from all bad things

You are not their parent

## How to Drive Good Decisions

### Create a Data-Driven Team Culture

Use data to justify decisions

### Flex Your Own Product Muscles

Taking the time to develop customer empathy is important

### Look into the Future

Ask the product team what the future might look like, and keep up with technical developments that may change how you think about writing software

### Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects

A/B testing results, metrics, customer behavior after a feature is added

### Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day

Gather measure of team's health regularly

Gain data about decisions made over time

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer

### Do's and Don'ts of Managing Conflict

- Don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting
- Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions
- Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues
- Do address issues without courting drama
- Don't take it out on other teams
- Do remember to be kind
- Don't be afraid
- Do get curious

## Challenging Situations: Team Cohesion Destroyers

Psychological safety is important

Toxic archetypes:

- The Brilliant Jerk
- The Noncommunicator
- The Employee Who Lacks Respect

## Advanced Project Management

### None of this is a replacement for agile project management

### You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter

### Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board

### As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no

### Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks

### Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate

## Assessing Your Own Experience

What are your new responsibilities now that youâ€™re the manager of a team? What tasks have you stopped doing or handed off to someone else in order to make time for these new responsibilities?

How well do you feel you know the day-to-day challenges of writing, deploying, and supporting code on your team?

How often does your team mark work as completed?

When was the last time you wrote a feature, debugged a problem, or paired with a member of your team on some code he or she was struggling with?

Are there one or two team members who cause the bulk of negativity on the team? What is your plan for getting rid of the problem moving forward?

Do your team members seem engaged with one another? Do they smile in meetings? Make jokes in chat? Get coffee or lunch together? When was the last time you all sat down together without talking about work?

How does your team make decisions? Do you have a process for assigning decision-making responsibility? What decisions do you hold yourself responsible for making?

When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals?

How well does your team understand why they are working on the projects they are working on?

When was the last time you cut scope on a project? What did you use to determine which pieces to cut?
