# Chapter 12 - Jobs

Jobs - good for short-lived, one-off tasks

A job creates Pods that run until successful termination (i.e., exit with 0). In contrast, a regular Pod will continually restart regardless of its exit code. Jobs are useful for things you only want to do once, such as database migrations or batch jobs. If run as a regular Pod, your database migration task would run in a loop, continually repopulating the database after every exit

## The Job Object

The Job object is responsible for creating and managing Pods defined in a template in the job specification. These Pods generally run until successful completion. The Job object coordinates running a number of Pods in parallel

If the Pod fails before a successful termination, the job controller will create a new Pod based on the Pod template in the job specification. Given that Pods have to be scheduled, there is a chance that your job will not execute if the required resources are not found by the scheduler. Also, due to the nature of distributed systems there is a small chance, during certain failure scenarios, that duplicate Pods will be created for a specific task

## Job Patterns

Jobs are designed to manage batch-like workloads where work items are processed by one or more Pods. By default, each job runs a single Pod once until successful termination. This job pattern is defined by two primary attributes of a job, namely the number of job completions and the number of Pods to run in parallel

| Type | Use case | Behavior | completions | parallelism |
|----|---|----|---|---|
|One shot|Database migrations|A single Pod running once until successful termination|1|1|
|Parallel fixed completions|Multiple Pods processing a set of work in parallel|One or more Pods running one or more times until reaching a fixed completion count|1+|1+|
|Work queue: parallel jobs|Multiple Pods processing from a centralized work queue|One or more Pods running once until successful termination|1|2+|

### One Shot

One-shot jobs provide a way to run a single Pod once until successful termination. While this may sound like an easy task, there is some work involved in pulling this off. First, a Pod must be created and submitted to the Kubernetes API. This is done using a Pod template defined in the job configuration. Once a job is up and running, the Pod backing the job must be monitored for successful termination. A job can fail for any number of reasons, including an application error, an uncaught exception during runtime, or a node failure before the job has a chance to complete. In all cases, the job controller is responsible for recreating the Pod until a successful termination occurs

```
$ kubectl run -i oneshot \
  --image=gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue \
  --restart=OnFailure \
  -- --keygen-enable \
     --keygen-exit-on-complete \
     --keygen-num-to-gen 10

```

Notes:
- The -i option to kubectl indicates that this is an interactive command. kubectl will wait until the job is running and then show the log output from the first (and in this case only) Pod in the job.
- --restart=OnFailure is the option that tells kubectl to create a Job object.
- All of the options after -- are command-line arguments to the container image. These instruct our test server (kuard) to generate 10 4,096-bit SSH keys and then exit.
- Your output may not match this exactly. kubectl often misses the first couple of lines of output with the -i option.

After the job has completed, the Job object and related Pod are still around. This is so that you can inspect the log output. Note that this job won’t show up in kubectl get jobs unless you pass the -a flag. Without this flag, kubectl hides completed jobs

Delete:

`$ kubectl delete jobs oneshot`

Example:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: oneshot
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kuard
        image: gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        args:
        - "--keygen-enable"
        - "--keygen-exit-on-complete"
        - "--keygen-num-to-gen=10"
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

```
$ kubectl describe jobs oneshot

Name:           oneshot

```

### Pod Failure

```
$ kubectl get pod -a -l job-name=oneshot

NAME            READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
oneshot-3ddk0   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   4          3m
```

It is not uncommon to have a bug someplace that causes a program to crash as soon as it starts. In that case, Kubernetes will wait a bit before restarting the Pod to avoid a crash loop eating resources on the node. This is all handled local to the node by the kubelet without the job being involved at all

```
$ kubectl get pod -l job-name=oneshot -a

NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oneshot-0wm49   0/1       Error     0          1m
oneshot-6h9s2   0/1       Error     0          39s
oneshot-hkzw0   1/1       Running   0          6s
oneshot-k5swz   0/1       Error     0          28s
oneshot-m1rdw   0/1       Error     0          19s
oneshot-x157b   0/1       Error     0          57s
```

What we see is that we have multiple Pods here that have errored out. By setting restartPolicy: Never we are telling the kubelet not to restart the Pod on failure, but rather just declare the Pod as failed. The Job object then notices and creates a replacement Pod. If you aren’t careful, this’ll create a lot of “junk” in your cluster. For this reason, we suggest you use restartPolicy: OnFailure so failed Pods are rerun in place

Workers can fail in other ways. Specifically, they can get stuck and not make any forward progress. To help cover this case, you can use liveness probes with jobs. If the liveness probe policy determines that a Pod is dead, it’ll be restarted/replaced for you

### Parallelism

Example:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: parallel
  labels:
    chapter: jobs
spec:
  parallelism: 5
  completions: 10
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        chapter: jobs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kuard
        image: gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        args:
        - "--keygen-enable"
        - "--keygen-exit-on-complete"
        - "--keygen-num-to-gen=10"
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

### Work Queues

#### Starting a Work Queue

Example:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: work-queue
    component: queue
    chapter: jobs
  name: queue
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: work-queue
        component: queue
        chapter: jobs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: queue
        image: "gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue"
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: work-queue
    component: queue
    chapter: jobs
  name: queue
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: work-queue
    component: queue
```

#### Loading Up the Queue

#### Creating the Consumer Job

#### Cleaning Up

`$ kubectl delete rs,svc,job -l chapter=jobs`

## CronJobs

`spec.schedule` field is used:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: example-cron
spec:
  # Run every fifth hour
  schedule: "0 */5 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: batch-job
            image: my-batch-image
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Summary

On a single cluster, Kubernetes can handle both long-running workloads such as web applications and short-lived workloads such as batch jobs. The job abstraction allows you to model batch job patterns ranging from simple one-time tasks to parallel jobs that process many items until work has been exhausted

Jobs are a low-level primitive and can be used directly for simple workloads. However, Kubernetes is built from the ground up to be extensible by higher-level objects. Jobs are no exception; they can easily be used by higher-level orchestration systems to take on more complex tasks
